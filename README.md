# SWS Gather App

## Status

A stateless, flexible and realtime micro web service to arrange SWS gathers for ENSL.org

## Design Goals

I'm making this app to promote 3 things

1) Create a nice place where the NS2 community can assemble and have fun
2) Create an efficient, easy-to-use and flexible system to create NS2 gathers
3) Support the modern web and basic usability expectactions (e.g. realtime, phone and tablet friendly)

That's it

## Run

```bash
npm install

npm start
```

## Todo

- ENSL.org: Authentication
- ENSL.org: Pull user data and bans
- ENSL.org: API to allow ENSL to pull current gather status
- Steam Integration: Pull hive stats
- Steam Integration: Outbound steam messaging
- Admin tools
- Add a backend datastore to persist gather data and messages
- Add sounds
- Add WebRTC for internal voice comms
- Add user lifeform + div information
